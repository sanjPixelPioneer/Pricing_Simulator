# 🧮 Product Pricing Simulator – Excel Dashboard Project

*A dynamic pricing simulator built using Microsoft Excel, designed to demonstrate how demand trends, seasonal changes, stock levels, and competitor prices impact product pricing decisions.*

## 📌 Project Summary
This project simulates a real-world pricing model for a variety of products across categories such as Apparel and Home Goods. It applies conditional pricing logic driven by business factors, calculating final prices and profitability. Insights are communicated via an interactive dashboard featuring pivot tables, charts, and slicers for dynamic filtering.
