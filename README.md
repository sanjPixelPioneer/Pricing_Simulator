# 🧮 Product Pricing Simulator – Excel Dashboard Project

*A dynamic pricing simulator built using Microsoft Excel, designed to demonstrate how demand trends, seasonal changes, stock levels, and competitor prices impact product pricing decisions.*

## 📌 Project Summary

This project simulates a **real-world pricing model** for a set of products across categories like **Apparel** and **Home**. It applies **conditional pricing logic** and calculates final prices based on business factors. The output is visualized via an **interactive dashboard** using pivot tables, charts, and slicers.

## 🚀 Features

- **Seasonal Impact** (e.g., Winter, Diwali, Summer)  
- **Demand Trend** (High, Medium, Low)  
- **Stock Modifier** (Low vs High inventory)

### ✅ Profit Margin Analysis
- Calculates **profit (₹ and %)** using cost and selling price  
- Highlights **high-margin** and **low-margin** products

### ✅ Competitor Benchmarking

- Tags products as:
  - `Too Expensive`
  - `OK`
